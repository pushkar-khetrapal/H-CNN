# H-CNN
This project proposes a different architecture of Deep learning that takes ‘n’ different uncorrelated features of same image/signal parallelly into non-shareable convolution input layers in the same network to predict classes. That is referred to as 1/2-D Hybrid-Convolutional Neural Network.
